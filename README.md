Drivers are concerned with the mileage obtained by their automoblies. They keep the track of their trips by recording miles driven and gallons used for each trip. So I have developed a C++ program that uses a while statement to input the miles driven and gallons used for each trip. The program calcultes and display the miles per gallon obtained for each tirp and print the combined miles per gallon obtained for all tankfuls up to this point.
